 FILE SYNTAX
-------------

Some sort of pseudo-xml; pseudo for being simplified a bit.

First there has to be `object' tag with argument indicating the type
of the object (`pie', `curve', `bar'). Inside the object block you may
have a `fname' tag, which tells the program the file in which the
output should be printed; defaults to stdout. Use `style' tag to link
some fancy CSS stylesheet to the diagram's .svg. Also, there should be
some `val' tags inside the object block. It takes an ID as an argument
and the actual value is inside the `val' block.

TL;DR: See `example'.
